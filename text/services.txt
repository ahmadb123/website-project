Real Esate:

The conventional photography can’t do justice to a big property no matter how good you are with your clicks. An estate with lawns, backyards, and water bodies can’t be presented with its full flaunt by ground images only. With aerial photography, you get the chance to offer the panoramic and a holistic  picture of any such property.

Weddings:

Drones can capture beautiful idyllic pictures and videos at outdoor weddings. Unlike cameras on the ground, a drone can capture aerial video of you walking down the aisle, then ascend to show a stunning panoramic view of your wedding venue.



Inspections:

Large equipment and tall structures often represent logistical challenges for an inspection team because of the difficulty in accessing elevated areas. Previous options for visually assessing a location hundreds of feet high were limited; either have a rope access technician descend from above or send a visual inspector up on a crane — the latter of which is expensive and both of which are potentially dangerous. Drone technology now affords inspectors a faster, safer, and more convenient alternative.
